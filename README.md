PONG game

## Single Player Pong Game
This is a very basic single-player Pong game created to familiarize myself with HTML canvas and basic animations using JavaScript.

## Gameplay
The game consists of a player paddle and a ball.
Control the player paddle using the Arrow Right and Arrow Left keys.
The goal is to prevent the ball from reaching the bottom of the screen by bouncing it off the player paddle.
Each time the ball hits the paddle, you score a point.
Whenever the socre is a multiple of 5, the ball velocity is incremented slightly.
The game keeps track of your score and top score.
